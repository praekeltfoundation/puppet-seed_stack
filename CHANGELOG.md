* praekeltfoundation/consular 0.2.0 module (#29)
* Consul 0.6.3 and Consul Template 0.12.2 (#30)

* Consul Template 0.12.1 (#22)
* Default the `hostname` parameter to `$::fqdn`. This makes it easier for Marathon/Mesos/Nginx to look up other nodes, especially on a public network (although you probably shouldn't be doing that). (#24)
